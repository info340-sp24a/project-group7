            <p>
                The domain we’re interested in exploring is plant care and gardening, specifically houseplants. 
                Many people, especially beginners, struggle with keeping their plants alive and healthy due to a lack of knowledge about proper care routines, watering schedules, sunlight/soil requirements, etc.
                Houseplant education is important for reasons such as improving air quality, stress reduction and sustainable living. 
                However, the lack of plant education often leads to plants dying unnecessarily, which not only wastes resources but also diminishes the potential benefits they could provide.
                Many people may purchase houseplants without fully understanding their specific requirements, leading to improper watering, inadequate light exposure and neglect. 
                This lack of knowledge can result in frustration and discouragement for individuals attempting to incorporate greenery into their homes.

                The information technology in this space is the need for an accessible and user-friendly platform that offers users with personalized plant care guidance tailored for their specific plant. 
                This website could provide general information, personalized recommendations  and  reminders for watering, sunlight, diagnosing or other important tasks tailored for each user’s specific plants. 
                How can we effectively educate individuals on houseplants and how to care for different species in a simple, accessible and user-friendly interface?

                The internet is overflowing with plant care advice, but sifting through endless websites and confusing apps can be overwhelming. 
                Many popular options lock essential features behind paywalls or worse, bombard you with shopping carts disguised as helpful guides. 
                We believe plant care should be accessible and straightforward. That's why we're building a completely free application, focused solely on nurturing your leafy companions. 
                No in-app purchases, no irrelevant clutter, just pure plant parenthood support!

                We want to utilize existing data to make the process of gathering plant information more efficient.
                The <cite><a href="https://perenual.com/docs/api">Perunual Plant API</a></cite> provides information on a variety of houseplants, garden plants, trees, and flowers.
                Users can search for information by species name, common name, or other keywords.
                The API provides details including botanical data, care guides, and images.
