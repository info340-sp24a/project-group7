            <p>
                The internet is overflowing with plant care advice, but sifting through endless websites and confusing apps can be overwhelming. 
                Many popular options lock essential features behind paywalls or worse, bombard you with shopping carts disguised as helpful guides. 
                We believe plant care should be accessible and straightforward. That's why we're building a completely free application, focused solely on nurturing your leafy companions. 
                No in-app purchases, no irrelevant clutter, just pure plant parenthood support!

                We want to utilize existing data to make the process of gathering plant information more efficient.
                The <cite><a href="https://perenual.com/docs/api">Perunual Plant API</a></cite> provides information on a variety of houseplants, garden plants, trees, and flowers.
                Users can search for information by species name, common name, or other keywords.
                The API provides details including botanical data, care guides, and images.
