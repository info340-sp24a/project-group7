      <h1>Monstera</h1>
      <p className="plant-blurb">The Monstera, also known as Monstera deliciosa or the Swiss Cheese Plant, is famous for its unique leaves that look like they're hole-punched, earning it its nickname. These holes aren't just for show; they help the plant in the wild by letting sunlight filter through dense forests. As a houseplant, Monstera is loved for its easy care and striking appearance. It needs bright but indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Plus, if you're lucky, it might even produce tasty fruit, though you'll want to wait until it's fully ripe to enjoy it safely. Overall, Monstera brings a touch of the tropics to any indoor space!</p>
